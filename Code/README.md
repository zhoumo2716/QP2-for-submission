# Project Code Overview

This repository contains Python code for the project, including simulations, analyses, and figure generation. Before running any simulations or analyses, please ensure that all required packages and functions are installed and loaded.

## Key Information:
- Each block of code is clearly commented, with detailed explanations at the start of each block. These comments explain the purpose of the code, such as:
  - Generating specific figures (e.g., "Figure 1" in the report)
  - Mimicking simulations from the original paper
  - Running simulation experiments for the extension analysis (e.g., "Simulation Experiment 1")

Please make sure all dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the code.
